## How to compile

### Dependencies

- [robdyn]: Dynamic simulator
    - Make sure you have installed `ODE` by sources and using this [trick](https://github.com/resibots/robdyn/issues/3#issuecomment-148740769).
    - Get the code: `git clone https://github.com/jbmouret/robdyn.git`
    - Configure for compilation/installation: `./waf configure`
    - Compile with `./waf`
    - Install robdyn on your computer: `sudo ./waf install`
    - For more advanced options, look at [robdyn]'s repo.
- [Sferes2]: A high-performance, multi-core, lightweight, generic C++98 framework for evolutionary computation.
    - Get the code: `git clone https://github.com/sferes2/sferes2`
    - For more advanced options, look at [Sferes2]'s repo.

### Compiling

- Make sure you have all the dependencies installed/downloaded.
- Go to your `sferes2` root directory
- Create a modules folder (if there's none) and cd to it: `mkdir modules && cd modules`
- Create a symbolic link to robdyn module (or you can copy it): `ln -s your_robdyn_dir/sferes/robdyn`
- Configure for compilation: `./waf configure --robdyn=robdyn_install_dir`
    - You can add other options if you want, like: `--cpp11=yes` to force C++11 compilation
- Compile sferes2 with: `./waf`
- Create an experiment folder (if there's none) and cd to it: `mkdir exp && cd exp`
- Clone map_elites_hexapod: `git clone https://github.com/resibots/map_elites_hexapod.git`
- Go back to your `sferes2` root directory
- Compile the experiment: `./waf --exp map_elites_hexapod`

## How to run

- Compile the experiment (as shown above)
- Run it (assuming you are on sferes2 root dir):
    - `./build/default/exp/map_elites_hexapod/hexa_duty_text`
    - `./build/debug/exp/map_elites_hexapod/hexa_duty_text` for the debug version
